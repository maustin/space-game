# Space Game!
### (working title)

## Description
Two ships face off in an epic 1v1 space battle!

## How It Works
First, each player will select 3 modules (out of a possible 10) to load onto their ships.
There are two type of modules
- Armaments provide a method to attack the enemy ship
- Mods provide either a defensive benefit or increase the effectiveness of an Armament

Armaments | Base Damage | Strong Vs | Weak Vs
---------- | ----- | -------- | --------
Laser | 20 | Shields | Armor
Gauss Cannon | 20 | Armor | Shields
Drones | 10 | | Drone Uplink Scrambler
Torpedoes | 10 | | Point Defense System

Modifications | Effect
---------- | ----------
Laser Amplifier | Increases laser damage by 50%
Gauss Charger | Increases gauss cannon damage by 50%
Point Defense System | 50% chance to destroy incoming torpedo
Drone Uplink Scrambler | Reduces drone damage by 50%
Shield Modulator | Increase shield power by 50%
Heavy Armor | Increase armor by 50%



Then, they will duke it out until only one ship is left.
